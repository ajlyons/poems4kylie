<h1>The Cremation of Sam McGee</h1>
<p><em>by Robert Service, 1907</em></p>
<p><em>There are strange things done in the midnight sun<br />
By the men who moil for gold;<br />
The Arctic trails have their secret tales<br />
That would make your blood run cold;<br />
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,<br />
But the queerest they ever did see<br />
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge<br />
I cremated Sam McGee.</em></p>
<p>Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.<br />
Why he left his home in the South to roam ’round the Pole, God only knows.<br />
He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;<br />
Though he’d often say in his homely way that he’d “sooner live in hell”.</p>
<p>On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail.<br />
Talk of your cold! through the parka’s fold it stabbed like a driven nail.<br />
If our eyes we’d close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn’t see;<br />
It wasn’t much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee.</p>
<p>And that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow,<br />
And the dogs were fed, and the stars o’erhead were dancing heel and toe,<br />
He turned to me, and “Cap,” says he, “I’ll cash in this trip, I guess;<br />
And if I do, I’m asking that you won’t refuse my last request.”</p>
<p>Well, he seemed so low that I couldn’t say no; then he says with a sort of moan:<br />
“It’s the cursed cold, and it’s got right hold till I’m chilled clean through to the bone.<br />
Yet ’tain’t being dead – it’s my awful dread of the icy grave that pains;<br />
So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you’ll cremate my last remains.”</p>
<p>A pal’s last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;<br />
And we started on at the streak of dawn; but God! he looked ghastly pale.<br />
He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee;<br />
And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee.</p>
<p>There wasn’t a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, horror-driven,<br />
With a corpse half hid that I couldn’t get rid, because of a promise given;<br />
It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say: “You may tax your brawn and brains,<br />
But you promised true, and it’s up to you to cremate those last remains.”</p>
<p>Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code.<br />
In the days to come, though my lips were dumb, in my heart how I cursed that load.<br />
In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies, round in a ring,<br />
Howled out their woes to the homeless snows – O God! how I loathed the thing.</p>
<p>And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow;<br />
And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low;<br />
The trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give in;<br />
And I’d often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin.</p>
<p>Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;<br />
It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice it was called the “Alice May”.<br />
And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum;<br />
Then “Here”, said I, with a sudden cry, “is my cre-ma-tor-eum.”</p>
<p>Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;<br />
Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel higher;<br />
The flames just soared, and the furnace roared – such a blaze you seldom see;<br />
And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee.</p>
<p>Then I made a hike, for I didn’t like to hear him sizzle so;<br />
And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to blow.<br />
It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I don’t know why;<br />
And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky.</p>
<p>I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;<br />
But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near;<br />
I was sick with dread, but I bravely said: “I’ll just take a peep inside.<br />
I guess he’s cooked, and it’s time I looked”;. . . then the door I opened wide.</p>
<p>And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar;<br />
And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: “Please close that door.<br />
It’s fine in here, but I greatly fear you’ll let in the cold and storm –<br />
Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, it’s the first time I’ve been warm.”</p>
<p><em>There are strange things done in the midnight sun<br />
By the men who moil for gold;<br />
The Arctic trails have their secret tales<br />
That would make your blood run cold;<br />
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,<br />
But the queerest they ever did see<br />
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge<br />
I cremated Sam McGee.</em></p>
