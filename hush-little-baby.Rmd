# Hush, Little Baby

*Traditional lullaby* ^[[*Hush, Little Baby*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush,_Little_Baby){target="_blank"} is a traditional lullaby, thought to have been written in the Southern United States. The lyrics promise all kinds of rewards to the child if he or she is quiet.]

Hush, little Baby, don't say a word,  
Mama's gonna buy you a Mockingbird.

And if that mockingbird don't sing,  
Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring.

And if that diamond ring turns brass,  
Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass.

And if that looking glass gets broke,  
Mama's gonna buy you a billy goat,

And if that billy goat won't pull,  
Mama's gonna buy you a cart and a bull.

And if that cart and bull turn over,  
Mama's gonna buy you a dog named Rover.

And if that dog named Rover won't bark,  
Mama's gonna buy you a horse and a cart.

And if that horse and cart fall down,  
You'll still be the sweetest little baby in town.
