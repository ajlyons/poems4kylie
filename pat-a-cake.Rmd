Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man  
Bake me a cake as fast as you can

Put it in the oven for baby and me

For baby and me  
For baby and me  
And there will be plenty for baby and me

Bake me a cake as fast as you can  
Pat it and prick it and mark it with "B"  
Put it in the oven for baby and me  

For baby and me  
For baby and me  
And there will be plenty for baby and me
